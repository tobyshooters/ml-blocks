Forked from: [Cleardusk's 3DDFA_V2](https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA_V2). I
did not write any of the functionality in this repo. Only did some gardening
and de-weeding.

This is all you need to get sparse keypoints from an image with absolutely
minimal dependencies.

This is also somewhat of a statement on repo hygiene.
