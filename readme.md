# Balloons

Balloons are simple. Remove weight to go up, deflate to go down. If you tie
several of them together, you can fly.

This is **not** a library. Code that's generic enough to work in any situation
usually lends itself to unreadable spaghetti. This is a reference, a place to
copy and paste from and re-format at will. The priority is simplicity and
readability.

I spend a lot of time cleaning up hacked code from abandoned research
codebases. I try to understand what the module is doing and then ruthlessly cut
unnecessary sections. If you try to read PyTorch or fastai's code, you'll spend
more time navigating files and weird class inheritances than looking at the
core mathematical section of what's happening. They encourage plug-and-play,
not understanding.
